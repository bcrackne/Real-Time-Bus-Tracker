# Real Time Bus Tracker
Week 9 MIT Assignment
## Refactored starter code provided by MIT staff to display bus stop locations between Harvard and MIT.
#### * Utilized Mapbox for map rendering.
#### * Changed map style to "Outdoors" for visual appeal.
#### * Changed the timer to update bus locations every 5 seconds.
#### * Displays bus locations in real time pulled from the MBTA API.

## Potential Improvements
#### Would like to add locations of other landmarks or possibly restaurants and other desirable locations.

## How to Run
#### Save .css, .js, and .html files to same directory/folder and drag and drop the .html file into the URL of your browser.
